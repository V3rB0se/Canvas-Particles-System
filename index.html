        <h1>1. Simple Canvas Particles System</h1>
        <p>Important Notes:</p>
        <p>I gave user all the options to create this crazy effect. you'll have to give value to each and every option i've added to this canvas effect system. read about these properties that are mandatory for this effect to work properly</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is Radius?</li>
            <p>In simple words (radius or area around mouse), In order to push particles away or create a magnet effect to (mouse area/radius) you'll have to define its radius. well lets try 500. remember 500 is good enough for this effect to work properly. </p>
            <li>What are these 2 effects?</li>
            <p>There are 2 effects. it's on user to choose between these 2 effects just try it. first one is magnet effect (all these arcs will react as magnet to mousemove or smartphone touchmove event) and second is push effect particles will react to cursor as it is infected with (corona lol) give it a try :P</p>
            <li>Paticles on screen?</li>
            <p>This is the third and last option for this effect to work. this is simply asking user how many particles to appear on canvas element for performance issues you can't give it a value of above 500.</p>
